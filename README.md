# logging-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and experimenting with logging libraries in the Java ecosystem.

---

The project illustrates different concepts, patterns and examples via standalone sub-projects:

### `slf4j-simple/`

A simple logging setup using SLF4J's `slf4j-simple` logging implementation.

See the README in [slf4j-simple/](slf4j-simple/). 

### `logback-filters/`

Using [Logback _Filters_](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/filters.html) to conditionally log some things and not others.
Useful, for example, to sample some logs that would otherwise be too numerous if enabled 100%.

See the README in [logback-filters/](logback-filters/).

### `java-core-logging/`

Showcasing Java's core logging facilities: `java.util.logging` (JUL) and `java.lang.System.Logger`.

See the README in [java-core-logging/](java-core-logging/).
